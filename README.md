The task is to calculate the following
financial metrics:
- profit for each month
- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit a after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year

All results need to be presented as vectors.
Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in Units of $1,000 (i.e. 1k) with no decimal points.
Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no decimal points.
